How does Microsoft 365 Copilot use your
proprietary organizational data?

Microsoft 365 Copilot provides value by connecting LLMs to your organizational data. Microsoft 365
Copilot accesses content and context through Microsoft Graph. It can generate responses anchored
in your organizational data, such as user documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings, and contacts.
Microsoft 365 Copilot combines this content with the user’s working context, such as the meeting a
user is in now, the email exchanges the user had on a topic, or the chat conversations the user had
last week. Microsoft 365 Copilot uses this combination of content and context to help provide

accurate, relevant, and contextual responses.

Prompts, responses, and data accessed through Microsoft Graph aren't used to train foundation

LLMs, including those used by Microsoft 365 Copilot.
