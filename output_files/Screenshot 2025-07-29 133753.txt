Who can view my conversations?

As part of our commitment to safe and responsible Al, we review conversations to improve our
systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.

Will you use my conversations for training?

When you use our services for individuals such as ChatGPT, we may use your content to train
our models. You can opt out of training through our privacy portal by clicking on “do not train
on my content,” or to turn off training for your ChatGPT conversations, follow the instructions

in our Data Controls FAQ. Once you opt out, new conversations will not be used to train our
models.

We don’t use content from our business offerings such as ChatGPT Team or ChatGPT
Enterprise to train our models. Please see our Enterprise Privacy page for information on how

we handle business data.
